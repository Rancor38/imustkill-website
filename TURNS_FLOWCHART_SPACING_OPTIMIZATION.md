# Turns Flowchart Spacing Optimization

## Overview

Optimized the turns flowchart spacing by reducing arrow size and padding to maximize text breathing room within the boxes.

## Changes Made

### Arrow Size Reduction

-   **Typography variant**: Changed from `h4` to `body1` for smaller, more proportional arrows
-   **Font size reduction**:
    -   Mobile: `1.5rem` → `1rem`
    -   Desktop: `2rem` → `1.2rem`
-   **Added explicit padding/margin reset**: `padding: 0, margin: 0` to eliminate default spacing

### Grid Gap Optimization

-   **Reduced grid gap**: `gap: { xs: 1, sm: 1 }` → `gap: { xs: 1, sm: 0.5 }`
-   **More space for content**: Arrows take up less space between columns
-   **Better proportion**: Text boxes get more relative space in the layout

### Chip Padding Reduction

-   **Label padding optimization**:
    -   Mobile: `8px 6px` → `6px 4px`
    -   Desktop: `12px 8px` → `8px 6px`
-   **More text space**: Reduced internal padding gives text more breathing room
-   **Maintained readability**: Still provides adequate spacing for comfortable reading

## Visual Benefits

### Enhanced Text Readability

-   **More breathing room**: Text has additional space within each box
-   **Better proportions**: Arrows don't dominate the visual space
-   **Cleaner layout**: Reduced clutter from oversized arrows and excessive padding

### Improved Balance

-   **Content-focused**: Text is now the primary visual element
-   **Subtle navigation**: Arrows provide flow guidance without overwhelming
-   **Professional appearance**: More refined spacing creates polished look

### Responsive Optimization

-   **Mobile efficiency**: Better space utilization on small screens
-   **Desktop enhancement**: Improved proportions on larger displays
-   **Consistent quality**: Maintains readability across all device sizes

## Technical Details

### Arrow Styling

```css
variant="body1"
fontSize: { xs: "1rem", sm: "1.2rem" }
padding: 0
margin: 0
```

### Grid Spacing

```css
gap: { xs: 1, sm: 0.5 }
```

### Chip Padding

```css
padding: { xs: "6px 4px", sm: "8px 6px" }
```

## Result

The flowchart now provides optimal text breathing room while maintaining clear visual flow, creating a more balanced and professional appearance that prioritizes content readability.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Turns flowchart spacing optimized for maximum text breathing room with appropriately sized arrows and minimal padding.
