## Game Mechanics Overview

### Core Game Concepts

1. **Stats System**:

    - **Body** - Strength, endurance, and physical prowess (lift, push, climb, drag, grapple, jump, swim)
    - **Agility** - Dexterity and nimbleness (catch, squeeze, pick locks, escape manacles)
    - **Focus** - Mental acuity and perception (perceive, listen, conjure magic, track prey, control will, resist enchantment)
    - **Fate** - Luck and life force (determines hit points)

2. **Combat System**:

    - Players choose one of several actions each turn: Attack, Dodge, Brace, gather a Power, Flee, or Negotiate
    - Roll 1d10 against your relevant stat; if the roll is lower, your action succeeds
    - Combat is deadly and strategic, with minimal hit points

3. **Magic System**:

    - Hunters can gather and cast powers through testing Focus
    - Powers are organized in decks and by rarity
    - Players can hold up to 3 powers at a time

4. **Equipment**:

    - Hunters begin with 10 random items
    - Equipment provides tactical advantages in combat

5. **Monsters**:
    - Creatures with unique abilities and weaknesses
    - Monsters require specific Insight levels to be perceived properly
    - Each creature has a full stat block and special abilities

### The Hunt Structure

1. **The Hook** - Introduction to the scenario
2. **Negotiate Pay** - Determine compensation
3. **The Rumor Phase** - Gather information about the monster
4. **The Research Phase** - Learn more details and possibly discover a weakness
5. **Prepare** - Gather necessary equipment
6. **Tracking the Monster** - Find or be ambushed by the creature
7. **The Fight** - Battle the monster
8. **Denouement** - Collect bounty, replenish equipment, rest, and level up

-   **React** - Frontend library for building the user interface
-   **Material UI** - Component library for consistent design
-   **React Router** - Navigation between different sections of the game

### Additional Development Information

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
