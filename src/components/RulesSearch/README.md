# KeywordLinker Component

The KeywordLinker component automatically detects and links game-related keywords and phrases in text content, providing users with quick access to rule definitions and navigation to full rule pages.

## How to Use

Simply wrap any text content with the KeywordLinker component:

```jsx
import KeywordLinker from "../components/RulesSearch/KeywordLinker"

// Basic usage
<KeywordLinker>
    When you attack, roll 1d10 against your Attack Stat.
    If your Insight is too low, the monster takes -1 damage.
</KeywordLinker>

// With Typography components
<Typography paragraph>
    <KeywordLinker>
        You can use Grit Teeth once per Night's Rest to regain 1 hit point.
        This requires Focus to gather a power from your power deck.
    </KeywordLinker>
</Typography>

// Disable linking for specific content
<KeywordLinker disabled={true}>
    This text won't have any keyword linking.
</KeywordLinker>
```

        they take -1 damage from your attacks.
    </KeywordLinker>
</ListItem>

// In multiple sections
<Typography paragraph>
    <KeywordLinker>
        Standard damage from conventional weapons such as swords, guns,
        clubs, and other mundane armaments. Most creatures can be harmed
        by Physical Damage, though some may have resistance or immunity
        to certain types of physical attacks.
    </KeywordLinker>
</Typography>

This creates an interconnected reference system where players can quickly understand game terms and navigate between related rules.
