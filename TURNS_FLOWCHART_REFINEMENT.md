# Turns Flowchart Refinement Update

## Overview

Refined the turns flowchart with improved sizing, simplified arrows, and unified gentle grey color scheme for a cleaner, more professional appearance.

## Visual Improvements

### Container-Fitted Design

-   **Full container width**: Boxes now stretch to fit their grid columns completely
-   **Fixed height**: Container set to 120px on desktop for consistent proportions
-   **Responsive stretch**: `alignItems: "stretch"` ensures boxes fill vertical space
-   **No overflow**: Removed fixed min/max widths that could cause container overflow

### Simplified Arrow Design

-   **Shorter arrows**: Changed from `→` to `▶` for a more compact, tailless design
-   **Reduced size**: Arrows now use `h4` variant instead of `h3` for better proportion
-   **Better alignment**: Arrows centered within their grid cells using flexbox
-   **Cleaner appearance**: No trailing tails or excessive visual weight

### Unified Color Scheme

-   **Gentle grey palette**: All boxes now use consistent grey tones instead of individual colors
-   **Dark mode**: Medium grey (`#424242`) background with light grey text (`#e0e0e0`)
-   **Light mode**: Light grey (`#f5f5f5`) background with dark grey text (`#424242`)
-   **Subtle borders**: Muted grey borders that complement the background
-   **Reduced shadows**: Lighter shadow for subtle depth without overwhelming the design

## Technical Changes

### Sizing Improvements

```css
height: { xs: "auto", sm: "100%" }
width: "100%"
maxWidth: "none"
```

### Color Standardization

```css
bgcolor: (theme) =>
    theme.palette.mode === "dark" ? "#424242" : "#f5f5f5"
color: (theme) =>
    theme.palette.mode === "dark" ? "#e0e0e0" : "#424242"
```

### Arrow Simplification

```css
fontSize: { xs: "1.5rem", sm: "2rem" }
fontWeight: "normal"
// Changed symbol from → to ▶
```

## Benefits

### Visual Cohesion

-   **Consistent appearance**: All steps have equal visual weight
-   **Professional look**: Unified color scheme creates cleaner design
-   **Better integration**: Matches the overall application's grey-based design system

### Improved Usability

-   **Better fit**: Boxes utilize full container space efficiently
-   **Clearer flow**: Simplified arrows don't distract from content
-   **Enhanced readability**: Gentle contrast is easier on the eyes

### Responsive Excellence

-   **Mobile optimized**: Maintains readability on small screens
-   **Desktop enhanced**: Takes full advantage of available space
-   **Consistent experience**: Same visual quality across all devices

## Design Philosophy

### Minimalist Approach

-   **Less visual noise**: Removed color distractions to focus on content
-   **Clean typography**: Reduced font weight and improved spacing
-   **Subtle effects**: Lighter shadows and borders for understated elegance

### Functional Design

-   **Content focus**: Color doesn't compete with text readability
-   **Clear hierarchy**: Number + text structure remains prominent
-   **Accessible**: High contrast ratios maintained in gentle grey scheme

## Status
